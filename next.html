                    <p>including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.</p>
                    <p>Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering</p>
                    <p>it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies,</p>
                    <p> in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies</p></h4>

                    <p>t heavily uses software configuration management[1][4] which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. </p></h4>
